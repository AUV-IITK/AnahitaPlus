This is a R\+OS package for interacting arduino through the \href{http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino}{\tt rosserial\+\_\+arduino} package. The package is meant to actuate thrusters connected to the arduino through a motor driver, and publish the measurements taken from various sensors connected to the arduino onto separate topics.

The {\ttfamily hardware\+\_\+arduino} package has been tested under \href{http://www.ros.org}{\tt R\+OS} Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.\+04 L\+TS. The source code is released under a B\+SD 3-\/\+Clause license.

The hardware used are as follows\+:

Run the following command to copy the udev rules specified for the Arduino port\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/catkin\_ws/src/auv2018/utils
sudo bash clone\_udev.sh
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries N\+O\+TE\+:} This connects the arduino always to the port named {\ttfamily /dev/arduino}.

Arduino will likely connect to computer as port {\ttfamily /dev/arduino}. The easiest way to make the determination is to unplug all other U\+SB devices, plug in your Arduino, then run the command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
ls /dev*
\end{DoxyCode}


Next make sure you have read/write access to the port. Assuming your Arduino is connected on {\ttfamily /dev/arduino}, run the command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
ls -l /dev/arduino
\end{DoxyCode}
 You should see an output similar to the following\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 2018-03-05 08:31 /dev/arduino
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that only root and the \char`\"{}dialout\char`\"{} group have read/write access. Therefore, you need to be a member of the dialout group. You only have to do this once and it should then work for all U\+SB devices you plug in later on.

To add yourself to the dialout group, run the command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo usermod -a -G dialout your\_user\_name
\end{DoxyCode}
 where {\ttfamily your\+\_\+user\+\_\+name} is your Linux login name. You will likely have to log out of your X-\/window session then log in again, or simply reboot your machine if you want to be sure.

When you log back in again, try the command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
groups
\end{DoxyCode}
 and you should see a list of groups you belong to including dialout.

Run the following command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/catkin\_ws
catkin\_make --pkg hardware\_arduino
\end{DoxyCode}


Run the following command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/catkin\_ws
source devel/setup.zsh
catkin\_make hardware\_arduino\_firmware\_arduino\_node    
catkin\_make hardware\_arduino\_firmware\_arduino\_node-upload     
\end{DoxyCode}

For technical definition of terms, refer to documentation \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_motions}{\tt here}.

To connect to the arduino, run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
roslaunch hardware\_arduino hardware\_arduino.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 First upload the code on arduino through Arduino I\+DE.

Subscribes to topics with P\+WM data and actuate the thrusters with that duty cycle, and also publishes the data obtained from pressure sensor
